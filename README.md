# Clean resume

Did you taste the cleanliness of that resume? Yes you do.

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%;">
    <img src="images/serif.png" alt="Inter Resume" style="flex-shrink: 1; flex-initial: 0;">
    <img src="images/sans-serif.png" alt="Latin Modern Resume" style="flex-shrink: 1; flex-initial: 0;">
</div>

## Usage

Take a look at the example file `main.tex`, and that's probably all you need to know.
